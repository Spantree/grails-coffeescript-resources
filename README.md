This is yet another coffeescript compile plugin for Grails framework.

It uses jCoffeeScript to compile .coffee files to .js. No need to have node.js with coffeescript installed on your system to have .coffee files compiled.

This plugin is more focused on grouping .coffee files into modules and compiling them into .js files. This is very good when you work with JavaScript MVC frameworks like Backbone which results in separated files for your models, views and controllers. You can find gdoc files to find example how to use it.
